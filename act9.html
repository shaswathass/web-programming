            I am S.S. Shaswatha, a 19-year-old student pursuing a <b>B.Tech in Computer Science with a
            specialization in the Internet of Things</b> at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I come from
            Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, and have a strong interest in technology, creativity, and learning new
            things. My journey so far has been about balancing academics with extracurricular activities.

            I completed my schooling at Yuvabharathi Public School in Coimbatore, where I actively
            participated in academics and extracurricular activities. As a <strong>trumpeter</strong> in my
            school band, I had the opportunity to perform at various events, showcasing my passion for
            music. I also excelled in sports and the arts, winning a gold medal in the Inter-School Sahodaya
            Competition for both dancing and swimming. Additionally, I represented my school in inter-school
            badminton and table tennis tournaments, reflecting my competitive spirit and love for sports.

            Exploring new places and trying different cuisines are my greatest joys. I have been fortunate to
            visit 12 countries, including Japan, Singapore, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany,
            Dubai, Indonesia, the UK, Scotland, Australia, and China. Among them, London stands out as my
            favorite city for its charm and vibrancy. My hobbies include dancing, watching movies, and
            listening to music. I also enjoy staying active by playing badminton, table tennis, and swimming,
            which keep me energized and focused.
